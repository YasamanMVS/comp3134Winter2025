Welcome to DigitalOcean's 1-Click LAMP Droplet.
To keep this Droplet secure, the UFW firewall is enabled.
All ports are BLOCKED except 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS).

In a web browser, you can view:
 * The LAMP 1-Click Quickstart guide: https://do.co/3gY97ha#start
 * Your LAMP website: http://137.184.171.149

On the server:
 * The default web root is located at /var/www/html
 * If you're using the embedded database, the MySQL root password
   is saved in /root/.digitalocean_password. If you've opted in to
   using a DBaaS instance with DigitalOcean, you will find your
   credentials written to /root/.digitalocean_dbaas_credentials
   and you will have access to a DATABASE_URL environment variable
   holding your database connection string.
 * Certbot is preinstalled. Run it to configure HTTPS. See
