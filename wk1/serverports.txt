1. What is the definition of server port?

Answer:
	A server port acts like a “door” on a computer or server. Whenever data arrives, the port number helps ensure it goes to the 
	correct application or service. Each port is uniquely identified by a number, so your system knows whether the data should 
	be handled by a web server, an email server, or another service.


2. What is the server port range?

Answer:
	Port numbers range from 0 to 65535.
	• Well-known ports (0–1023): Used by core or standard services (e.g., web servers on port 80).
	• Registered ports (1024–49151): Assigned to specific services or applications (e.g., databases, email services).
	• Dynamic/private ports (49152–65535): Often assigned randomly for temporary uses (like in peer-to-peer connections).


3. How many bits does the number above represent?

Answer:
	Because a port number can go up to 65535, it fits in a 16-bit unsigned integer.
